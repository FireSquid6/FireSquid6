# About
I'm a game developer from Austin, Texas. Design is mostly my strongsuit, but I'm a fairly decent Gamemaker Studio 2 programmer as well and am learning Godot. I used to be a competitive Splatoon 2 player, but quit to focus on studying game design and working on my programming and design skills. While playing splatoon I grew fond of studying multiplayer games and the interlocking systems within them with a team, and one day hope to create a game that will give that experience to another generation of players.  
  
 Some of my favorite games are:  
 - Cyber Manhunt
 - Into the Breach
 - Terraria
 - Starbound
 - Ghostrunner
 - The Pedestrian
 - All of the Half Life and Portal games
 - Minecraft
 - One Step from Eden
 - Enter the Gungeon
 - Project Highrise
 - Teamfight Manager
 - Subnautica
 - Stardew Valley
 - This War of Mine
 - Hotline Miami 1 and 2
 - The Orwell Games
 - This War of Mine
 - Ultrakill
 - Celeste
 - Splitgate
 - Splatoon 2

# My Projects
## [Function Factory](https://github.com/FireSquid6/Function-Factory)
Function Factory is a game I developed from October of 2021 - idk when as of writing this I haven't completed it. It's a math based puzzle game that's easier to show than tell, so click the link for more info. 
  
## [Teleorb](https://github.com/FireSquid6/teleorb)
Teleorb is a platformer I developed in the summer of 2021. It uses the main mechanic of an orb inspired by the minecraft enderpearl to get you around. It has a lot of underlying design and technical issues, but was the first game I finished, and one I plan to revisit one day.
  
## [Ajax Corps](https://github.com/FireSquid6/ajax_corps)
Ajax Corps is a top-down action shooter that started development in late May of 2021. In late June of 2021 I quickly salvaged what I could out of the project and finished the levels I had, since my original design plan for it failed. As of Nobember of 2021 I am writing up a design doc for a game similar to it that I will make in Godot. 
  
## [ModUI](https://github.com/FireSquid6/modui)
ModUI is my personal UI library for GMS2. It's built around the ability to easily modify and "plugin" extra functions to each UI element while still having the library do most of the heavy lifting. Stuff like animation and custom effects should be pretty easy with this UI system. (Yes I know the world doesn't need anymore GML UI libraries)
  
 ## [Ultima BR](https://github.com/beegyfleeg/ultima)
 I helped do some of the map design for a minecraft minigame [beegyfleeg](https://github.com/beegyfleeg) made.
