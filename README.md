Main Projects:  
GDPlatformer (Coming Soon) - A platformer controller for Godot. Has planned support for things such as cyote time, jump curves, and input buffering to make programming platform games that much easier.  
[Function Factory](https://github.com/FireSquid6/Function-Factory) - A math-based puzzle game made in Godot  
[Modui](https://github.com/FireSquid6/modui) - A UI library for Gamemaker Studio 2
