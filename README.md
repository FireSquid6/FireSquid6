# About
I'm a game developer from Austin, Texas. Design is mostly my strongsuit, but I'm a fairly decent Gamemaker Studio 2 programmer as well and am learning Godot. I used to be a competitive Splatoon 2 player, but quit to focus on studying game design and working on my programming and skills. While playing splatoon I grew fond of studying multiplayer games and the interlocking systems within them with a team, and one day hope to create a game that will give that experience to another generation of players.  
  
 Some of my favorite games are:  
 - Cyber Manhunt
 - Omori
 - Into the Breach
 - Terraria
 - Ghostrunner
 - The Pedestrian
 - Half Life 2
 - Minecraft
 - Lacuna
 - Hotline Miami 1 and 2
 - The Orwell Games
 - Ultrakill
 - Celeste
 - Splatoon 2
 - Road 96
 - Noita

# My Projects
## [Teleorb](https://github.com/FireSquid6/teleorb)
Teleorb is a platformer I developed in the summer of 2021. It uses the main mechanic of an orb inspired by the minecraft enderpearl to get you around. Levels are similar to celeste in that they are designed to have the player use their abilities in a creative way to complete them, but also have an element of speed, similar to the way the good sonic games are built. It only has 1 complete level made up of several rooms, but I plan to rebuild the project in Godot at some point to add more to it.

 ## [Ultima BR](https://github.com/beegyfleeg/ultima)
 I helped do some of the map design for a minecraft minigame [beegyfleeg](https://github.com/beegyfleeg) made. Ultima is a game where 2-4 players fight to be the last person standing, with the twist being that if the person who killed you dies, you respawn. This means you need to kill every player in a row to win the game. Each map has different kits and events to shake up strategies and gameplay between each one. I made specifically the maps `Bathouse`, `King of the Hill`, and `Reflection`. You can read more about these individual maps below.
  
*Bathouse has players spawn on the 4 corners with the threat of weakening water below . Once a player falls into water, the only way to get back up is by crawling to their spawn area. Players can choose to take the harder parkour route to the gold blocks in the middle for extra resources, or take the safer route and get to the centre platform without an extra buff.*

*King of the Hill has each player spawn on the 4 oak protrusions and jump down with knockback sticks. If players fall into the black wool, they die. After a varied amount of time, the player on the central red concrete will be crowned king for a bit, and given a rapid-fire crossbow. All of the other players must try to not die or fight back and knock the king off.*

*Reflection has players battle eachother with rocket fireworks and enderpearls. players can go between the two reflected layers by shifting/jumping on the red or blue blocks respectively. Since rocket explosions are reflected on both layers, combat on this map becomes fast paced and chaotic.*

## [Ajax Corps](https://github.com/FireSquid6/ajax_corps)
Ajax Corps is a top-down action shooter that started development in late May of 2021. In late June of 2021 I quickly salvaged what I could out of the project and finished the levels I had, since my original design plan for it failed due to me not conducting enough playtesting sessions. Many of the levels were unfun due to the player dying too quickly to enemies offscreen that I, the level designer, knew about but the player didn't 
  
## [ModUI](https://github.com/FireSquid6/modui)
ModUI is my personal UI library for GMS2. (by personal I mean I'm making up an excuse for the nonexistant documentation) It's built around the ability to easily modify and "plugin" extra functions to each UI element while still having the library do most of the heavy lifting. Stuff like animation and custom effects should be pretty easy with this UI system. (Yes I know the world doesn't need anymore GML UI libraries)
