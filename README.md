# About
I'm a game developer from Austin, Texas. Design is mostly my strongsuit, but I'm an intermediate Gamemaker Studio 2 programmer as well. I used to be a competitive Splatoon 2 player, but quit to focus on studying game design and working on my programming skills. While playing splatoon I grew fond of studying multiplayer games and the interlocking systems within them with a team, and one day hope to create a game that will give that experience to another generation of players.  
  
 Some of my favorite games are:  
 - Cyber Manhunt
 - Into the Breach
 - Terraria
 - Starbound (modded ofc)
 - Ghostrunner
 - The Pedestrian
 - All of the Half Life and Portal games
 - Minecraft
 - One Step from Eden
 - Enter the Gungeon
 - Wargroove
 - Hades
 - Project Highrise
 - Teamfight Manager
 - Subnautica
 - Stardew Valley
 - Beat Saber

# My Projects
## [Ajax Corps](https://github.com/FireSquid6/ajax_corps)
Ajax Corps is a top-down action shooter that started development in late May of 2021. It is in early alpha as of July 2021 and I would expect it to be out around October or November. Check the github for it to play pre-release versions or eventually the full release once it's out.
  
## [ModUI](https://github.com/FireSquid6/modui)
ModUI is a modular UI library for GMS2. There's a ton of UI Libraries for GMS2, and this one is mostly for personal use but I'm gonna put it out to the public once it's done. It's built around the ability to easily modify and "plugin" extra functions to each UI element while still having the library do most of the heavy lifting.  
  
 ## [Ultima BR](https://github.com/beegyfleeg/ultima)
 I helped do some of the map design for a minecraft minigame [beegyfleeg](https://github.com/beegyfleeg) made.
